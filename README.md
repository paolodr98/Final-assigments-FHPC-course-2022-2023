# Final-assigments-FHPC-course-2022-2023
This is the Repo with the resolution of the exercises of the assignments for the exam of Foundation of High Performance Computing
There are two folders, each related to one of the two exercises, and the final report summarizing the work done. 
All simulations were carried out using the [ORFEO](https://orfeo-doc.areasciencepark.it) supercomputer.

### Exercise 1

It consists in a scalability analysis of a parallelized version written in `C` using `OpenMP` and `MPI` of the famous Conway's Game of Life.

### Exercise 2

It consists in an analysis of three different libraries for the calculation of the product between matrices. The libraries are `MKL`, `OpenBLAS`, and `BLIS`. It's studied the scalability for different number of core used and the size of the matrices
